                    Welcome to SmartShop. By accessing or using our website and voice services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Use of Services</h3>
                <p>
                    You agree to use SmartShop only for lawful purposes. You must not use our platform to transmit any harmful code, interfere with our operations, or attempt to access restricted areas.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Account Responsibility</h3>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Product Descriptions</h3>
                <p>
                    We strive to be as accurate as possible. However, SmartShop does not warrant that product descriptions or other content are error-free. If a product offered is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Voice AI Limitations</h3>
                <p>
                    Our AI assistant is designed to help you find products. While sophisticated, it may occasionally misinterpret commands. SmartShop is not liable for unintended orders resulting from unclear voice commands, though we will assist in rectifying genuine errors.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Governing Law</h3>
